## HistXtract
HistXtract is a pipeline for extracting nuclear morphometry features from whole-slide images. This algorithm delineates individual cell nuclei in images of hematoxylin & eosin stained sections and calculates a quantitative feature profile describing the shape, texture and color of each nucleus. This information can be used with machine-learning algorithms to identify
