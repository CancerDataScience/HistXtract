## HistXtract
HistXtract is a pipeline for extracting nuclear morphometry features from whole-slide images. This algorithm delineates individual cell nuclei in images of hematoxylin & eosin stained sections and calculates a quantitative feature profile describing the shape, texture and color of each nucleus. This information can be used with machine-learning algorithms to identify

## Dependencies
HistXtract uses functions from [MatDigitalPathology](https://github.com/CancerDataScience/MatDigitalPathology) and the [OpenSlide](http://openslide.org/) project to analyze whole-slide images.
